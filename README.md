## Community Leaders
Any member of the Community with access to the support area, can offer themselves as a candidate for the role of Community Leader by filling in the [Community Leader Application Form](https://dyno.gg/form/22670037) (hosted by Dyno, also found in the Submissions forum).

Moderators will have a quick internal conversation to see if any of them has an objection to the candidate, if the majority of the Moderators is in favor of the candidacy, Community Leaders will be informed of the candidacy in the CL Application Review post, so they can offer their own possible objections.

Once Moderators are satisfied with the collected feedback, if no objection was offered, the candidate should be promoted to the role, otherwise a Supermajority vote will be held to decide the outcome of the candidacy.

Once the outcome of the candidacy has been determined, the candidate CL will be informed of the outcome, in case of a rejected candidacy, further feedback can be offered to allow the candidate to apply again after addressing the feedback areas.

## Moderators
Community Leaders can offer themselves as a candidate for the role of Moderator by filling in the [Moderator Application Form](https://dyno.gg/form/12e0de74).

Moderators will have a quick internal conversation to see if any of them has an objection to the candidate, if the majority of the Moderators is in favor of the candidacy, Community Leaders will be informed of the candidacy in the CL-General post, so they can offer their own possible objections.

Moderators will hold a Supermajority vote to accept the candidacy.

# Article VII - Leadership Communication
The following policies must be followed by leaders within the leadership channels:
1. Follow the overarching Community rules.
2. Leadership chats shall remain on topic.
3. Treat conversation within leadership channels as privileged information not to be shared outside of those channels without having obtained explicit consent of the parties involved in the conversation.
4. In person leader meetings shall be recorded by a volunteer.

Moderators and Community Leaders are expected to be familiar with the Bylaws and refer to the [Discord Safety Library](https://discord.com/safety-library) for formation and instruction on how to safely and effectively manage a Community.

# Article VIII - Resolutions

## Proposal
Moderators can open a Resolution for voting by creating a post in the Voting Log forum.

Other users can propose a Resolution through a ticket or via a DM to a Moderator, a Moderator can then sponsor this Resolution and open it up for debate and subsequent vote, the sponsor will ensure that timely updates on the status of the Resolution are offered to the person who made the initial proposal.

Some of the Special Resolutions listed in the article below may offer additional instructions pertinent to their specific circumstances.

## Voting
Resolutions are considered passed by a Simple Majority vote from Moderators.

Votes are tallied up the moment in which the mathematical certainty of the vote outcome is reached.

If after 48 hrs of a vote being open, due to abstained votes, an outcome can't be reached, the Resolution sponsor, can extend the voting window by 48 hrs longer, until a Resolution is reached.

Resolutions that are voted down, will require the proposal to be revised before re-submission.

## Execution
Unless otherwise agreed upon, the Moderator who created the voting post is going to be in charge of executing the decision.

# Article IX - Special Resolutions

## Private Report Resolution
Some Resolutions will need special treatment due to the high sensitivity of the subject they cover.

For instance, the user authoring the report may fear retaliation or want to maintain discretion for other reasons.

Any Resolution proposing disciplinary action towards one or more Moderators is automatically considered a Private Report Resolution.

### Proposal
In order to ensure that feedback and issues can be resolved effectively in the event that a member does not trust every Moderator, and to protect the Server member(s) from any form of retaliation, these steps will need to be employed to address a Private Report:

1. Moderators will be expected to accept and receive DMs from any member of the Server containing Server-related concerns. Moderators will privately collect 
information about the situation reported and keep the member apprised of their progress.
2. If the Moderator decides that the information is sufficient for action, they will become the Sponsor of this Resolution and negotiate with the reporting member which additional Moderators can be included in a new, private chat, and what information can be shared with them.
3. The Sponsor will then meet with the selected Moderators, provide the agreed upon background to the situation, facilitate any follow-up discussion(s), and finally organize a preliminary private vote on the Resolution.
4. If this preliminary vote indicates that there is not sufficient support in the selected group, they will reach out to the original reporting member, to ask which details of the story can be shared with the Moderators at large for an official vote.
5. The final version of the Resolution will be drafted by the Sponsor using the information deemed acceptable for sharing with the Moderator group at large (as much or as little as it can be acceptable).

Preliminary votes and private discussion are to be conducted by the subgroup of Moderators in a private channel outside the Server. Sharing copies of the discussion outside this channel is forbidden.

For further assistance, refer to the "Private Reporting Script" Appendix document.

### Voting
Once the Resolution is drafted Moderators will hold a vote:
* Supermajority vote in case of disciplinary Resolution towards a Moderator.
* Supermajority vote in case the Resolution falls in one of the other Special Resolution cases as described below.
* Simple Majority vote in the other cases.

### Execution
Retaliation in response to a Resolution is not tolerated, and Moderators are invited to bring punitive Resolutions to a vote in case this behavior occurs.

If an action is to be taken towards a Moderator, the Sponsor can request that the Server Owner take this action, even if the action is directed at the Server Owner, the Server Owner is expected to execute it in a timely fashion or risk a vote of No-Confidence.

## Bylaws Amendment Resolution
Resolutions aimed at modifying these Bylaws are subject to the following:

### Proposal
The full text of the updated rule shall be offered in the forum post for the amendment Resolution.

### Voting
Amendments are approved through a Supermajority vote of the Moderators.

### Execution
Once the Bylaws are modified, an updated document shall be made available to the full Community as well as a changelog of the edits.

Moderators are invited to download a copy of the updated Bylaws and keep it stored, to prevent non-ratified changes from happening.

## No-Confidence Resolution
In case a Server Owner fails to execute a Resolution that was voted upon by the Moderators, a Motion of No-Confidence can be initiated.

The intent of this measure is to ensure the Server Owner compliance with the Bylaws.

### Voting
Should at least two Moderators identify that the Server Owner has not discharged their responsibility according to the Bylaws and the structure of the Resolution, they may create a DM channel with all Moderators except the Server Owner to hold a Supermajority vote on a Motion of No-Confidence.

### Execution
1. If the vote passes all Moderators will remove their Moderator role as a message to the Server that there is no longer confidence in the Server leadership.
2. This is a rare and extreme measure, and is likely to lead to a reset of the Community in a new Server. 
3. It is required that all the Moderators will respect a vote of No-Confidence, regardless of their own vote(s).
