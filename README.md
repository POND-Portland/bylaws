# Article VIII - Resolutions

## Proposal
Moderators can open a resolution for voting by creating a post in the Voting Log forum.

Other users can propose a resolution through a ticket or via a DM a Moderator, a Moderator can then sponsor this resolution and open it up for debate and subsequent vote, the sponsor will ensure that timely updates on the status of the Resolution are offered to the person who made the initial proposal.

Some of the special resolutions listed in the article below may offer additional instructions for special type of resolutions.

## Voting
Resolutions are considered passed by a Simple Majority vote from Moderators.

Votes are tallied up the moment in which the mathematical certainty of the vote outcome is reached.

If after 48 hrs of a vote being open, due to abstained votes, an outcome can't be reached, the resolution sponsor, can extend the voting window by 48 hrs longer, until a resolution is reached.

Resolutions that are voted down, will require the proposal to be revised before re-submission.

## Execution
Unless otherwise agreed upon, the Moderator who created the voting post is going to be in charge of executing the decision.

# Article IX - Special Resolutions

## Private Report Resolution
Some resolutions will need special treatment due to the high sensitivity of the subject they cover, the user reporting the issue may fear retaliation or want to maintain discretion for other reasons, this automatically includes any resolution towards disciplinary action for one or more moderators, these resolutions are subject to the following:

### Proposal
In order to ensure that feedback and issues can be resolved effectively in the event that a member does not trust every member with the Mod role, and to protect the server member(s) from retaliation by a member in a leadership role these steps will need to be employed to address a private report:

1. Moderators will be expected to accept and receive DMs from any member of the server containing server related concerns. Moderators will privately collect 
information about the situation reported and keep the member apprised of their progress.
2. If the Moderator decides that the information is sufficient for action, they will become the Sponsor of this resolution and negotiate with the reporting member which additional Moderators can be included in a new, private chat, and what information can be shared with them.
3. The Sponsor will then meet with the selected Moderators, provide the agreed upon background to the situation, facilitate any follow-up discussion(s), and finally organize a preliminary private vote on the resolution.
4. If this preliminary vote indicates that there is not sufficient support in the selected group, they will reach out to the original reporting member, to ask which details of the story can be shared with the Moderators at large for an official vote.
5. The final version of the resolution will be drafted by the Sponsor using the information deemed acceptable for sharing with the Moderator group at large (as much or as little as it can be acceptable).

Preliminary votes and private discussion are to be conducted by the subgroup of Moderators in a private channel outside the server. Sharing copies of the discussion outside this channel is forbidden.

For further assistance, refer to the "Private Reporting Script" Appendix document.

### Voting
Once the resolution is drafted Moderators will hold a vote:
* Supermajority vote in case of disciplinary resolution towards a Moderator.
* Supermajority vote in case the resolution falls in one of the other special resolution cases as described below.
* Simple Majority vote in the other cases.

### Execution
Retaliation in response to a resolution is not tolerated, and Moderators are invited to bring punitive resolutions to a vote in case this behavior occurs.

If an action is to be taken towards a Moderator, the Sponsor can request that the Server Owner take this action, even if the action is directed at the Server Owner, the Server Owner is expected to execute it in a timely fashion or risk a vote of No-Confidence.

## Bylaws Amendment Resolution
Resolutions aimed at modifying these Bylaws are subject to the following:

### Proposal
The full text of the updated rule shall be offered in the forum post for the amendment resolution.

### Voting
Amendments are approved through a Supermajority vote of the Moderators.

### Execution
Once the Bylaws are modified, an updated document shall be made available to the full community as well as a changelog of the edits.

Moderators are invited to download a copy of the updated Bylaws and keep it stored, to prevent non-ratified changes from happening.

## No-Confidence Resolution
In case a Server Owner fails to execute a resolution that was voted upon by the Moderators, a motion of no confidence can be initiated.

The intent of this measure is to ensure the Server Owner compliance with the bylaws.

### Voting
Should at least two Moderators identify that the Server Owner has not discharged their responsibility according to the bylaws and the structure of the resolution, they may create a DM channel with all Moderators but the Server Owner to hold a Supermajority vote on a motion of no confidence.

### Execution
1. If the vote passes all Moderators will remove their Moderator role as a message to the server that there is no longer confidence in the server leadership.
2. This is a rare and extreme measure, and is likely to lead to a reset of the community in a new server. 
3. It is required that all the Moderators will respect a vote of No Confidence, regardless of their own vote(s).
