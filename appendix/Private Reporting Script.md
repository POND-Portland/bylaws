# Appendix A: Private Reporting Script 

Tailor this script according to your use case, the following are examples for how to proceed through each stage. 
1. I understand your concern about the situation, could you give me more details so I can have a better picture of the events? Whatever you tell me, I will keep it in confidence between us. We will figure out how to inform the rest of the Mods about this later, in a way that keeps you safe from repercussions. 
2. Okay, with the full picture you presented, I agree that this situation needs to be addressed. Ultimately this will mean that the Mod team will have to vote on a resolution, but before then I will have a private chat with a smaller group of Mods so we can ensure their support. This smaller group of Mods will need to have some sense of the situation, and I don’t want to share with them anything you don’t explicitly indicate you want shared. 
So, here are some Mods I think would be sympathetic to the proposal [Mod list], are there any of these Mods you don’t want involved at first, or would you like to include another Mod I haven’t mentioned? 
3. Good, so now we have agreed on a list of mods, what can I tell them? Keep in mind that it doesn’t need to be the full story you told me, but it needs to be enough so we can convince them of the validity of your concerns. I’ll let you know when we reach a point I think is sufficient for presenting the case. 
    1. TOO LITTLE INFO: Hm, I don’t think this is enough information, I can try and run with this, but it’s going to be a hard sell. 
    2. ENOUGH INFO: Okay, this is enough to make the case, I’ll set up the meeting, and let you know how it went as soon as I can. 
4. POST VOTE 
    1. VOTE SUCCEEDED: The vote succeeded, so we’re going to go to the full Mod team, and indicate we’re pursuing this resolution. Is there anything you want me to let them know before I present it? 
    2. VOTE FAILED: Okay, so I apparently didn’t have enough information to sway some opinions, here’s some aspects I think may be useful to share [...], is there anything in this list you’re willing to share? Should we change who’s in the internal group? 
        1. TOO LITTLE INFO: I see, well, as it stands, I agree that we should pass that motion, but I don’t think I can convince the rest of the Mod team to get on board, if you want, we can pursue another resolution (go back to point 2), or we can drop the matter altogether. 
        2. ENOUGH INFO: Okay, I’ll convene the selected group and we will vote again (go back to point 4). 
5. POST FINAL VOTE: Okay, the vote happened, and it went [...], thank you for your patience and bringing this up to our attention. Any closing notes before we consider this matter settled?
